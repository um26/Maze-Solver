# Quiz Application

## Overview
The **Quiz Application** is a simple and interactive program that allows you to create and play quizzes directly from the console. It demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, including encapsulation and abstraction.

## Features
- Create quizzes with a custom title and questions.
- Add multiple-choice questions (4 options per question).
- Play any created quiz and receive a score.

## Learning Outcomes
This project is designed to help you learn:
- Object-oriented programming in Java.
- Working with collections (`ArrayList`).
- Console-based user interfaces.
- Modular design by separating classes into different files.

## How It Works
1. **Creating a Quiz**: Add a title and multiple questions with options.
2. **Playing a Quiz**: Answer questions and receive immediate feedback.
3. **Scoring**: Get a final score at the end of the quiz.

## Example Usage
- Add a "Java Basics" quiz with questions about syntax and fundamentals.
- Play the quiz to test your Java knowledge.

## Future Enhancements
- Store quizzes persistently (e.g., using files or a database).
- Add support for true/false and open-ended questions.
- Improve the user interface with a GUI.
