# Simple Calculator

## Overview
This project is a basic calculator built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI). It supports essential arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Key Features
- **Graphical Interface**: A clean and intuitive interface built with Java Swing.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message when attempting division by zero.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: For the application logic.
- **Java Swing**: For the GUI.

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Run the Program**: Compile and run `Calculator.java` in a Java-compatible IDE or command line.

## Usage
- **Buttons 0-9**: Enter numbers.
- **Operators (+, -, *, /)**: Choose the arithmetic operation.
- **Equals (=)**: Displays the result of the operation.
- **Clear (C)**: Resets the current input and calculation.

## Code Structure
- **Calculator.java**: Main Java file containing the GUI setup and application logic.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Learning Objectives
This project demonstrates:
- GUI design using Java Swing.
- Event handling with ActionListeners.
- Basic arithmetic operation implementation in Java.

## Future Improvements
- **Advanced Operations**: Implement square root, exponentiation, etc.
- **Memory Functions**: Add memory recall and save functionalities.
- **Error Messages**: Enhanced error handling and messages for invalid inputs.
