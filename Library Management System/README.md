# Library Management System

## Overview
The **Library Management System** is a console-based application designed to manage books, members, and borrowing activities. It showcases object-oriented programming principles and practical usage of collections in Java. This project is ideal for understanding the interaction between multiple classes in a real-world context.

## Features
### Book Management
- Add new books to the library.
- Search for books by title or author.
- Display a list of available books.

### Member Management
- Register new members.
- View all registered members.

### Borrowing and Returning
- Borrow books by members with validation checks.
- Return books and update their availability status.

## Learning Outcomes
This project is designed to help you:
- Implement **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Java (Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Abstraction).
- Use **Collections Framework** (`ArrayList`) to manage dynamic data.
- Design modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
- Practice real-world problem-solving.

## How It Works
1. **Book Operations**
   - Add new books with details like title, author, and availability.
   - Search books by their title or author.
   - View all available books.

2. **Member Operations**
   - Add new members with unique IDs and names.
   - View all registered members.

3. **Borrowing and Returning**
   - Members can borrow books if available.
   - Borrowed books are marked as unavailable until returned.
   - Members can return borrowed books, updating their availability.

## Example Usage
- **Add a New Book**: `Book("1984", "George Orwell")`
- **Add a Member**: `Member("John Doe")`
- **Borrowing**: 
   - `John Doe borrows "1984"` → Success if available.
- **Returning**: 
   - `John Doe returns "1984"` → The book becomes available again.

## Future Enhancements
- Add persistent storage using file handling or a database.
- Implement fine calculations for overdue returns.
- Add graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
- Enable advanced search with filters for genre, year, etc.
