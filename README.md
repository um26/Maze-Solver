# Java Projects Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Java-based projects developed to enhance programming skills and showcase real-world problem-solving capabilities. Each project is designed with a focus on **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles, **clean code structure**, and **practical use cases**.

## Projects Included

### 1. **Simple Calculator**
- **Description**: A basic calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Built using Swing for GUI, it provides a hands-on introduction to Java's event-handling and graphical capabilities.
- **Learning Focus**:  
  - GUI development with `JFrame` and `JTextField`.  
  - Event handling with `ActionListener`.  
- [Detailed Project ReadMe](./SimpleCalculator/README.md)

### 2. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**
- **Description**: A classic two-player game implemented using a text-based interface. Players take turns to mark spaces on a grid, with a win condition of aligning three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
- **Learning Focus**:  
  - Implementation of game logic.  
  - Working with arrays and control structures.  
- [Detailed Project ReadMe](./TicTacToe/README.md)

### 3. **Expense Tracker**
- **Description**: A simple console application to manage and track daily expenses. Users can add, view, and calculate the total of their expenses.
- **Learning Focus**:  
  - Use of `ArrayList` for dynamic data storage.  
  - Creating interactive command-line applications.  
- [Detailed Project ReadMe](./ExpenseTracker/README.md)

### 4. **Library Management System**
- **Description**: A comprehensive console-based system to manage library books and member activities. Includes features like book borrowing, returning, and member registration.
- **Learning Focus**:  
  - Collaboration between multiple classes using OOP principles.  
  - Handling real-world scenarios with modular design.  
- [Detailed Project ReadMe](./LibraryManagementSystem/README.md)

## Goals of This Repository
- **Learning-Oriented**: Each project is chosen and implemented to enhance specific Java skills.  
- **Real-World Applications**: Projects simulate real-life systems for a better understanding of programming challenges.  
- **Clean Code & Modularity**: The code follows structured design practices to ensure readability and reusability.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Java SE**: Core Java features and libraries.
- **Swing**: For GUI-based projects like the Calculator.
- **Collections Framework**: `ArrayList` for dynamic data handling.
- **OOP Principles**: Encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the specific project directory.
2. Each project contains its own `README.md` with detailed instructions and explanations.
3. Open the `.java` files to explore the source code or execute them to see the application in action.

## Future Enhancements
- Expand existing projects with additional features and complexity.
- Add new projects to cover advanced topics like multi-threading, file I/O, and database integration.
- Implement GUI versions of text-based applications.
